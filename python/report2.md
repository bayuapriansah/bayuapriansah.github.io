**Daily Sync Thu 10 Jul – Quick Consolidation**

**1 | Handbook – final fixes**

* **Branding/terminology**

  * Tagline = *“Sustainable Living Lab together with Meta”* (per Meta guidelines).
  * Show both logos under “Organised by” (Meta = sponsor, not organiser).
  * Program name: **“Youth Development for Climate-Tech”** – drop “the” & “Program”.
* **Content & wording**

  * Use **“Ideathon”** everywhere (replace “Idea Submission”). ✔️ matches your note.
  * Schedule note: replace “students from Indonesia…” → “participants in on-campus boot-camps follow their university timetable.”
  * Add “What you’ll need” box (laptop, stable internet, email + Discord account).
* **Design tidy-ups**

  * One **calendar-style** timeline for Virtual Exchange (Tues/Thu/Sat columns + weekly milestones).
  * Funnel page: align icons, add simple symbols for colour-blind users, shrink human count visual, globe icon for Global Showcase.
  * Cover & TOC: unify fonts, swap student-only photos for a climate-tech collage.
  * QC all fonts/alignments (page 8, code-of-conduct text sizes, arrow positions).
* **Ground-rules tweaks**

  * Rename **“Student Handbook” → “Participant Handbook”**.
  * Discord: clarify “change your server nickname to real name (First Last)” + link/QR (non-expiring).

**Owners:** Janani (layout), Russell (content comments), Sabrina/design team (visuals), Bayu (Discord link).

**2 | Zoom upgrade – DONE**

* **[info@sustainablelivinglab.org](mailto:info@sustainablelivinglab.org)** now on **Webinar 500** plan (USD 79/mo).
* All kickoff/FT links must be recreated as webinars **tomorrow before the Friday email blast**; duplicate settings for speed (polls, Q\&A on, recording, registration off).
* Run a quick trial to:

  1. Check name-capture flow & attendance export.
  2. Test polls & host un-mute flow.

**Owners:** Jeevan (new links + poll bank), Russell/Bayu (ops test), Dalia (billing confirmed).
