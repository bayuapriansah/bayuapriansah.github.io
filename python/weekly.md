Here’s the **consolidated discussion points** from the **Meta Climate Tech Project - Weekly Sync (Jul 17, 2025)** in the same style and structure as the example you provided:

---

### Weekly Sync Thurs 7/17:

1. **Update Deck for Meta (Gavin)**
   1. Overview: Project introduction, timeline, KPIs, milestones, key numbers, and budget allocation.
   2. Collaterals: To include select visuals (1 backup slide).
   3. Budget: Phase-based breakdown; total use of \~\$150K (USD), simplified to \~\$90K Meta + \$13K Ecound for prototyping.
   4. Emphasis on clear, visually simple breakdowns for Veera & Aaqib to present.
   5. Next step: Heet to send breakdown figures; Leo to help with visual layout for problem owner logos & themes.

2. **Problem Statements & Owners**
   1. Numbers to be adjusted based on confirmed vs. potential statements.
   2. Avoid inflating expectations—align slides with realistic confirmed figures.
   3. Include logos of confirmed orgs + title-only list of problem statements (grouped by themes).
   4. Clarification: Must tie each statement to a real-world org (no purely theoretical owners).
   5. Suggestion: Prepare 3-tiered view: confirmed, connected-not-confirmed, and unadopted but real-world issues.
   6. Leo to assist Russell in visualizing ownership/themes via color-coded graphics.

3. **Masterclass & Virtual Exchange Planning**
   1. Format: Split between cultural sessions (internal-led) and masterclasses (external orgs).
   2. Kickoff: First session on Oct 4, led by Bayu & Jeevan.
   3. Scheduling: Tues/Thurs (evenings), weekends (afternoons) for 4 weeks.
   4. Heet to draft outreach template for masterclass orgs (objectives, audience, scope).
   5. Backup plan: If orgs unavailable, internal experts (e.g. Anushka, Avin, Wani) may run sessions.
   6. Emphasis: Ensure session content doesn’t overlap with foundational training; focus on case-based dialogue.
   7. Suggestion: Use "Ask Me Anything" format or guided Q\&A for richer engagement.
      
4. **Foundational Training Feedback (Trainer Support)**
   1. Menti background color adjusted (white for visibility).
   2. Tech tip: Encourage dual-screen setups to avoid disrupting presenter mode.
   3. Pre-check video audio; read captions if muted.
   4. Avoid excessive scanning (limit to 1 Mentimeter + 1 Feedback Form).
   5. Consider using chat-based links instead of scanning QR codes.
   6. Trainers to practice co-host “interjection” moments for engagement.
   7. Enable reactions in chat for quick participant feedback.
   8. Bayu & Heet to join upcoming Zoom sessions to familiarize with webinar tools.

5. **Prototyping, Deployment, and Showcase Budget**
   1. Total Estimations (USD):
      * Prototyping: \$15K (30 teams @ \$500, milestone-based disbursement).
      * Deployment: \~\$35K (travel-heavy or remote deployments, 7:3 split).
      * Showcase: \~\$20K (venue, travel, accommodation, insurance).
   2. Suggestions:
      * Visa & travel insurance must be included.
      * Double flight estimates to account for rising costs & peak travel.
      * Local teams to validate real ticket prices (e.g. Indonesia to SG).
   3. Russell to adjust showcase date & buffer timeline based on team confirmation (\~Dec).
   4. Delivery of IoT kits: To be handled by admin teams, not via cash disbursement.
   5. Cash disbursement discouraged to avoid tax/legal complications.

6. **Virtual Exchange Timeline & Logistics**
   1. Problem statements released during IDE.
   2. Organic team formation on Discord (Week 1); formal submission in Week 2.
   3. Final team review & solution refinement: Week 3.
   4. Oct 4: Mentoring & prototyping phase kickoff (Bayu & Jeevan).
   5. Submission form includes: team info, proposed solution, and (later) bill of materials.

7. **Follow-ups & Assignments**
   1. Heet to draft external org masterclass outreach template by Friday.
   2. Leo to mock up basic visualization of logos/themes.
   3. Bayu to assist Janio in preparing collaterals for Jogja + upcoming Indonesia launches.
   4. Heet & Jeevan to align on Zoom tech prep and prototyping disbursement flow.
   5. Team to finalize showcase travel budget with updated flight, insurance, and visa costs.

8. **Indonesia Update**
   1. Jogja Launch on Monday – attended by local mayor & press.
   2. West Java (Jul 28) and East Java (early Aug) tentative launch timelines.
