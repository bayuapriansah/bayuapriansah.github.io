**Daily Sync – Wed 16 Jul**

* **Foundational-Training (FT) SOP**
  * @Bayu walked the full run-sheet; checklist now split into **day-before / during / after** sections.
  * Support flow clarified:
    * **Info@** account starts *practice mode*; all ops/tech join first.
    * Trainers & any speakers join via **personal panelist links** only *after* practice mode starts.
    * @Theresa adding screenshots to SOP for “Start Practice Session” button.
  * Post-session workflow finalised: download Zoom attendee CSV → save to *Organisers Drive* → update **Master Attendance Sheet** (column for *Attended / Excused / Absent* + tick-box for Do-One submission).

* **Panelist links**
  * @Izbat to add **every YDCT team member** (ops, tech, managers) as panelists for **all FT webinars** – not just trainers – so they can join without manual promotion.

* **Feedback & Do-One Activity**
  * One Google Form template duplicated per session; link dropped in chat **15 min before end**, *before* Do-One Activity slide.
  * Do-One Activity decks include submission links; no hard deadline, but trainers need to remind the participant “complete within 2 days.”

* **Registration & Comms**
  * Only **57** FT-1 registrations so far; @Russell to blast reminder email today and @Bayu to ping on Discord Announcements.

* **Virtual Exchange (VE)**
  * Schedule will mirror FT timings (weekday evenings / weekend afternoons).
  * **Team-formation flow**:
    1. Dedicated Discord channels for idea-pitching & matchmaking (organic).
    2. Google Form for team submission opens 13 Sep, closes 27 Sep.
  * **Cultural sessions – owners**
